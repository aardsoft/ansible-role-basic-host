# So far this supports simple timers with OnCalendar trigger as cron replacement.
# Eventually it should get expanded to fully support systemd timers, though the
# convenience wrappers might receive less functionality.
#
# The ability to use both a copied script or a command is present in the timer
# file, but not yet supported by this role. If a script is present it should be
# copied, and used as command.
#
# This file is the main entry point for adding more than one timer, and for
# adding host-specific timers through 'systemd_timers' on basic_host run.
#
# For adding/removing a single timer include add_timer or remove_timer. See
# documentation in those files for details.

# this is the entry point to include when trying to perform access setup
# through delegates (like for container deployment). This includes only
# tasks which correctly handle delegation, and special care needs to be
# taken not to break that when touching files included here.
#
# So far only suse is supported.
#
# Delegated access setup only does the following steps:
# - configure core repositories
# - install basic packages
# - create and configure management user
